# Cgo(tchas): The Presentation Slides
These are the slides for a talk I gave at the Boulder Gophers meetup on [April 9th 2015](http://www.meetup.com/Boulder-Gophers/events/221265779/)

Background notes and source for the talk can be found in the talk.slide file.

In order to run the presentation slides,
install the [go present](https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/tools/present) tool
and run the “present” program in this directory.

The command for installing the present tool was:
```
go get code.google.com/p/go.tools/cmd/present
```
... but Google Code was being decommissioned at the time of this writing.
