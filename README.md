# (Go) Build Your Own Lisp

This repository tracks my progress working through the book [Build Your Own Lisp](http://buildyourownlisp.com) by [Daniel Holden](https://github.com/orangeduck) using the [Go](http://golang.org) programming language.

#### ... wait, wasnâ€™t that book about coding a Lisp in C?

After signing up for both [LambaConf](http://www.degoesconsulting.com/lambdaconf-2015/) and [GopherCon](http://gophercon.com/) for 2015, I thought it would be fun to implement a toy functional programming language in Go. Translating the C examples into equivalent Go was also an hands-on way to experiment with my understanding of both languages.

# Dependencies

This repository makes extensive use of the [mpc](https://github.com/orangeduck/mpc) library required by the book. [Cgo](http://golang.org/cmd/cgo/) is used to integrate this C code with the rest of the Go-based project.

An isolated branch also includes some experimentation with integrating [editline](https://github.com/troglobit/editline) into the command prompt code.
